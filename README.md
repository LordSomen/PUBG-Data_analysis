# PUBG-Data_analysis

In this project we are doing a data analysis on the Pubg players data to understand different aspects of the players.

## Description

Cleaning , Data  preparing , Analysis , Data Visualization and Understanding of PUBG Playerâ€™s Data for finding some answers to some questions related to a player's game style. 
Itâ€™s written in Python. For data cleaning , data preparation and simple analysis; PANDA has been used . For Data visualization SEABORN is used. 



## Tech Stack

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Lessons Learned

We have Learned how to clean the data, do data wrangling and then visualize data using different Graphical Representation.
One of the main challenge is to data visualization using this huge amount of data and data cleaning because the data is really messy.
Also I have shown how you can use data to find answers to different questions, with proof as graphical representation of the data.
